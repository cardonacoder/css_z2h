## [CSS Specificity](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_specificity.asp)

"If there are two or more conflicting CSS rules that point to the same element, the browser follows some rules to determine which one **is most specific** and therefore wins out" (w3schools.com)

Hierarchy:

1. Inline styles
2. IDs
3. Classes, attributes and pseudo-classes
4. Elements and pseudo-elements

## Pseudo selectors - [Elements](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_pseudo_elements.asp) & [classes](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_pseudo_classes.asp)

- A CSS pseudo-element is used to **style specified parts** of an element
- A CSS pseudo-class is used to **define a special state** of an element

## [Advanced selectors](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_selectors.asp)

- **element_1+element_2**: Selects the first **element_2** element that is placed immediately after **element_1** elements
